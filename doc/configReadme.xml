			<![CDATA[
I want to aggregate products from Salesforce and SAP and compare them to see which products can only be found in one of the two and which products are in both instances.

For practical purposes this Template will generate the result in the format of a CSV Report sent by e-mail.

This Template should serve as a foundation for extracting data from two systems, aggregating data, comparing values of fields for the objects and generating a report on the differences.

As implemented, it gets products from Salesforce and materials from SAP, compares by the name of the products, and generates a CSV file which shows product in Salesforce, product in SAP, and products in Salesforce and SAP. The report is then e-mailed to a configured group of e-mail addresses.

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly.
**Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

Before continue with the use of this Anypoint Template, you may want to check out this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/SAP+Connector#SAPConnector-EnablingYourStudioProjectforSAP), that will teach you how to work 
with SAP and Anypoint Studio.

## Disclaimer

This Anypoint template uses a few private Maven dependencies from Mulesoft in order to work. If you intend to run this template with Maven support,.you need to add three dependencies in the pom.xml file that begin with the following group id: 
	**com.sap.conn.jco** or **com.sap.conn.idoc**

Once your app is all set and started, supposing you choose as domain name `template-sfdc2sap-product-aggregation` to trigger the use case you just need to hit `http://template-sfdc2sap-product-aggregation.cloudhub.io/generatereport` and report will be sent to the e-mails configured.

After this, to trigger the use case you just need to hit the local HTTP endpoint with the port you configured in your file. If this is, for instance, `9090` then you should hit: `http://localhost:9090/generatereport` and this will create a CSV report and send it to the e-mails set.

Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. However, we make API call to Salesforce only once during aggregation.

This is the file where you will found the endpoint to start the aggregation. This Template has an HTTP Inbound Endpoint as the way to trigger the use case.
$H$H# Trigger Flow
**HTTP Inbound Endpoint** - Start Report Generation
+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `generatereport` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.

Functional aspect of the Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of conducting the aggregation of data, comparing records and finally formating the output, in this case being a report.
Using Scatter-Gather component we are querying the data in different systems. After that the aggregation is implemented in DataWeave 2 script using Transform component.
Aggregated results are sorted by source of existence:
1. Products only in Salesforce
2. Products (Materials) only in SAP
3. Products (Materials) in both Salesforce and SAP 
and transformed to CSV format. Final report in CSV format is sent to email, that you configured in mule.*.properties file.
